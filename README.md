**MacOS / Linux**

The game is not made to run natively on anything other than Windows. However, it is possible to play it Mac and Linux using Wine or Whiskey.

Refer to these tutorials:

## Contributing to the game

Pokémon Infinite Fusion is open-source! All of the game's code is located in the Data/Scripts folder.

We accept pull requests for bug fixes and minor features* (Please contact chardub on the game's Discord if you have a feature idea to get it pre-approved before you start working on it!)

**Note: Any pull request that modifies the RPG Maker files outside of the Scripts folder will be automatically denied. 
This includes any changes to the maps/game events. The reason for this is that unfortunately, the way RPG Maker XP's data
files are structured does not allow to easily see what the changes made are.**

To contribute:

- Fork the game's repo from https://github.com/infinitefusion/infinitefusion-e18
- Work from the **develop** branch to avoid merge conflicts 
- Open a pull request once you're done to merge into **develop**. A pull request should only contain a single feature or bug fix. Any PR that bundles multiple features/fixes will be denied.

**There is no guarantee that submitted pull requests will be accepted.*
